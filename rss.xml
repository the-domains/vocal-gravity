            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Letters To Rachael</h1><p>Letters to RachaelDear Rachael, They say love is blind, but I think it's just deep-sighted. It makes you close your eyes and see with your mind. And that's how you do me, Stranger; you make me see with my mind. Sometimes I see us, you and I, and we have neither past nor present, no...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/77df7653096e3ec72e3dc98c82a1f087/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fashiwel.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F03%2Fletters-to-rachael.jpg%3Ffit%3D440%252C330"></article>]]></description>

My fascination with healed wounds began as a little boy, through those endless primary school days, when after each football game and after each attempt to dive at the ball in style like I often saw on my neighbor's black and white TV with the twin doors, I'd come home with at least four...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ba2f0ae4f71b629cfa8ef3d81efd785c/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fashiwel.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F12%2Fscars-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
